// This module exports several useful types and functions related to working with the GitHub API.

// The `Octokit` class is the main entry point for interacting with the GitHub API. It provides a convenient interface for making authenticated requests to the API.
export { Octokit, RequestError } from "./octokit";

// These types define the shape of the `pageInfo` object that is returned by some API responses. The `PageInfoForward` type is used when paginating forward through a list of results, while the `PageInfoBackward` type is used when paginating backward.
export type { PageInfoForward, PageInfoBackward } from "./octokit";

// The `App` class provides a convenient way to create a GitHub App that can be used to authenticate with the GitHub API. The `OAuthApp` class is similar, but is used for OAuth-based authentication.
// The `createNodeMiddleware` function can be used to create a middleware function that can be used with a Node.js server to handle authentication and API requests.
export { App, OAuthApp, createNodeMiddleware } from "./app";
