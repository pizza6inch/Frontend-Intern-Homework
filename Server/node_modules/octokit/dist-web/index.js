// pkg/dist-src/octokit.js
// This file imports the core Octokit package and several plugins to extend its functionality.
// The plugins include:
// - restEndpointMethods: Adds support for REST endpoint methods.
// - paginateRest: Adds support for paginating through REST API responses.
// - paginateGraphql: Adds support for paginating through GraphQL API responses.
// - retry: Adds support for retrying failed requests.
// - throttling: Adds support for handling rate limits.

// pkg/dist-src/version.js
// This file exports a single variable, VERSION, which contains the current version of the octokit.js package.
const VERSION = "3.1.2";

// pkg/dist-src/octokit.js
// This file defines the Octokit class, which is the main entry point for interacting with the GitHub API.
// It is created by calling the plugin method on the OctokitCore class and passing in the previously imported plugins.
// The defaults method is used to set default options for all instances of the Octokit class.
// These defaults include the user agent string and a throttle object with two methods: onRateLimit and onSecondaryRateLimit.

// These methods are called when the request rate limit is reached or exceeded.
// They log a warning message and check the retryCount property of the request object.
// If the retryCount is 0, they set the retry flag to true and return it, allowing the request to be retried.

// pkg/dist-src/app.js
// This file imports the DefaultApp and DefaultOAuthApp classes from the @octokit/app package.
// It also imports the Octokit class, RequestError class, and createNodeMiddleware function from the previously discussed octokit.js file.
// The DefaultApp and DefaultOAuthApp classes are used to create custom app classes with default options.
// The Octokit class is imported without any modifications.
// The RequestError class is used to create error objects when an API request fails.
// The createNodeMiddleware function is used to create a middleware function for use in Node.js applications.

// The App and OAuthApp classes are then exported, along with the Octokit, RequestError, and createNodeMiddleware symbols.
